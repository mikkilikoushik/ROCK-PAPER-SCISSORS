📄 requirements.txt

Create a file named requirements.txt and add this:

# No external dependencies required
# Uses only Python standard library

🛠️ Install Command

Even though there are no dependencies, you can still run the standard command:

pip install random

✅ Why this works

random is part of Python’s standard library

No third-party packages are used

📌 Optional (if you want to look more professional)

You can also mention the Python version:

python>=3.7
